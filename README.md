# Scala 2 Examples

This repository holds two separate projects:

* **LanguageDemos** contains numerous short sample programs, covering all the features of the Scala language. Types from the [Cats Library](https://typelevel.org/cats/) are used in some of the more complex samples.
* **ScalaCheckDemos** contains samples of the [ScalaCheck](https://scalacheck.org/) library for Poperty Based Testing, both standalone and in combination with [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/). These are included as examples of how Scala supports FP Patterns, like Monadic Composition, to practical effect.

The projects were built and tested using [IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala Plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/get-started-with-scala.html).
